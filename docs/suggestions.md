# App Suggestions

The first app built with the Keyp onboarding stack was [Treasure Chess](https://treasure.chess.com). Treasure Chess allows users to log in with their existing chess.com accounts, participate in an NFT collecting game, access a gasless NFT marketplace using USDC, and buy items with credit cards. These were all major UX improvements over most dapps being built. Consider how those improvements could apply to your apps.

## Games

Any game that would like to turn its economy into a real economy, easily turn game items into secure collectables, or give their players the power and ownership of web3, should consider building with Keyp. Keyp's tools can help with item management, account creation, authenticating users, and more.

Optionally, give players the ability to trade items or game-currencies between different games and domains.

## Social Apps

Keyp is a great fit for social, community, or crowd funding apps. Making sure your app is accessible to more people is important for its success. By giving users the ability to log in with accounts they are familiar with, and only have to onramp themselves once, you can expand your user base.
