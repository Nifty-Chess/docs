# Security

User accounts creating on Keyp are non-custodial in nature: we do not store any private keys, nor have the ability the ability to.

## Service Providers

Keyp is partnered with and built on top of [web3auth](https://web3auth.io/) to take advantage of their excellent security protocols.

### Difference between Keyp logins and web3auth

Keyp has added a number of account features:

- Improved Permissions system, so users and approve daily spending limits, item specific tokens approval, and more.
- Users get the same public address between multiple different apps built on Keyp, making it easy to see all their items in one place, and providing the benefit of **only having to onboard users new to web3 once**, instead of once per app.
- Gasless transaction tools
