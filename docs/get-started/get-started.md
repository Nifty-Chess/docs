# Welcome to Keyp üç©

Keyp creates developer tools for game studios and app developers to improve the web3 onboarding experience.

We want to create a future where people have universal ownership and autonomy over their digital assets.‚Äç

After building dozens of apps - we realized we were missing an onboarding platform that could bring web3 to everyone. In order to create more accessibility, we built the most interoperable web3 onboarding platform for developers.

When we say **interoperable**, we mean:

- Every EVM-compatible network, defi protocol, and smart contract.
- Any country. Any bank.
- Wallets are not isolated to your application and can be used anywhere.

When we say **onboarding**, we mean:

- Everyone, even those with no web3 experience, can access a wallet, move funds and accomplish their goals.

Checkout the [Quick Start](docs/get-started/intro.md) to get started.
