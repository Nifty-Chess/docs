# Welcome to Keyp üç©

Keyp creates developer tools for game studios and app developers to improve the Web3 onboarding experience.

We want to create a future where people have universal ownership and autonomy over their digital assets.‚Äç

After building dozens of apps - we realized we were missing an onboarding platform that could bring Web3 to everyone. In order to create more accessibility, we built the most interoperable and scalable onboarding platform for developers.

When we say interoperable, we mean:

```js
// Any web3 network. Any defi protocol. Any smart contract.

// Any country. Any Bank.

// You application is not isolated, but is connected with a network of other applications and users
```

When we say scalable, we mean:

```js
// Up to 1M users is completely free
```

When we say onboarding, we mean:

```js
// We spend the last 5 years working in crypto so we could solve this problem.

// Everyone is welcome, even those without web3 experience

// Users feel welcome, and never frustrated
```
