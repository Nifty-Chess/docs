## Apps without Backends

Your app might be built without a backend, and just built on top of smart contracts, like [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) for example. This makes it more complicated to create logins, because you have no OAuth server running to verify your users are who they say they are. We're currently exploring some solutions for this. If your app has no backend, please reach out to us and we can talk about the additional security implications required for the integration.
